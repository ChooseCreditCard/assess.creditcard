      <h2>What Does It Mean to Assess a Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>To assess a credit card is to form a clear, fact-based view of how it behaves over time. Instead of focusing on slogans like “no annual fee” or “extra rewards”, assessment treats the card as a bundle of documented terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>This includes interest structures, fees, reward rules, protections, technology features and how the issuer can change the product. An assessment describes these elements clearly; it does not predict outcomes for any specific person.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>A Neutral Assessment Checklist</h2>
      <p>A repeatable assessment checklist helps you read product documentation in the same way every time. One neutral structure might include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Pricing &amp; costs</strong> – APR ranges, grace periods, FX fees, annual fees and other charges.</li>
        <li><strong>Rewards &amp; earning</strong> – earn rates, categories, caps, expiration rules and devaluation risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Protections &amp; insurance</strong> – types of coverage, limits, exclusions and claim processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology &amp; controls</strong> – virtual cards, wallets, alerts, spend controls and security features.</li>
        <li><strong>Issuer policies</strong> – change clauses, communication practices and support channels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By applying the same checklist to every product, differences become clearer without declaring any card “good” or “bad”.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Using Official Documents as the Primary Source</h2>
      <p>Marketing copy can be helpful for orientation, but assessment is grounded in the official sources: cardholder agreements, pricing addenda and policy wording. These documents specify:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>How and when APRs can change</li>
        <li>Which fees apply under which scenarios</li>
        <li>Exactly which events are covered by protections and insurance</li>
        <li>How introductory offers start, end or revert to standard terms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Assessment involves locating these details and paraphrasing them into plain language without changing their meaning.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Assessing Risk Factors Without Personal Advice</h2>
      <p>Risk assessment looks at how a product might behave under stress: late payments, high utilization, missed deadlines or changes in market rates. Documentation typically explains:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>What happens after late or missed payments (including any penalty APRs)</li>
        <li>How fees stack when multiple events occur in the same cycle</li>
        <li>How variable APRs may move with reference rates</li>
        <li>How and when the issuer can revise terms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A neutral assessment highlights these mechanisms but does not attempt to predict an individual outcome or give personal risk recommendations.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>From Assessment to Comparison Structures</h2>
      <p>Once each card has been assessed using the same dimensions, the information can be placed into comparison tables and guides. The underlying philosophy stays the same: explain the mechanics and trade-offs, avoid “best card” claims.</p>
      <p>This documentation-first approach is the basis for how many comparison pages and guides are organized on Choose.Creditcard.</p>
