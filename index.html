      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>Assessment vs. Comparison</h2>
      <p>Comparison looks across many cards at once. Assessment zooms in on one offer at a time: the pricing, perks, risks and how it fits your habits. You can think of assessment as a <strong>deep dive</strong> on a short list of candidates that survived the first comparison round.</p>
      <p>The goal is not to find a perfect card, but to understand what you are trading off: cost vs. benefits, flexibility vs. complexity, and short-term perks vs. long-term fit.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Steps -->
    <section id="steps" class="section">
      <h2>Practical Steps for Assessing a Card</h2>
      <p>Use this sequence when you open a card’s marketing page or documentation:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Start with the fee box:</strong> Note annual fee, FX fee, cash advance fee, late fee and any extra cardholder charges.</li>
        <li><strong>Read the rewards section slowly:</strong> Identify base earn rate, bonus categories, caps, tiers and expiry rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Find the insurance section:</strong> Look for travel, purchase, rental car and other protections – plus main exclusions.</li>
        <li><strong>Check the tech features:</strong> Virtual cards, card controls, spending alerts, wallets and digital ID options.</li>
        <li><strong>Map it to your usage:</strong> Apply your own monthly spending, travel pattern and currency exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider your credit profile:</strong> Is this card positioned for “starter”, “rebuild” or “premium” customers?</li>
        <li><strong>List open questions:</strong> Anything unclear should be treated as a risk until you can confirm it.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="small">
        This process takes more time than scrolling a “top 10” list, but it gives you a concrete understanding of what the card is actually offering you, not an average customer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Pros & Cons Matrix -->
    <section id="matrix" class="section">
      <h2>Build a Simple Pros &amp; Cons Matrix</h2>
      <p>Once you’ve read the offer, turn it into a simple matrix. This makes it easier to compare one assessed card against another later.</p>
      <div class="table-wrap">
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Area</th>
              <th>Pros for You</th>
              <th>Cons / Risks</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Fees &amp; FX</td>
              <td>Annual fee reasonable for your planned usage; FX fee acceptable for how often you travel.</td>
              <td>Hidden surcharges, high cash advance or ATM fees, FX % that makes travel expensive.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Rewards</td>
              <td>Earns meaningful rewards in categories you actually use, with simple redemption.</td>
              <td>Complex tiers, low value redemptions, rewards locked into a program you rarely use.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Protections</td>
              <td>Travel and purchase protections that replace cover you’d otherwise buy separately.</td>
              <td>Many exclusions, low limits, overlap with existing insurance you already pay for.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Technology</td>
              <td>App and controls that match how you like to manage money (alerts, limits, virtual cards).</td>
              <td>Limited app, poor controls, missing wallets or security features important to you.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Credit impact</td>
              <td>Fits your score range and long-term plan (e.g. building history with a single provider).</td>
              <td>Hard checks with low approval odds, or a product that doesn’t fit your current profile.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p class="small">
        If the “Cons / Risks” column feels longer and heavier than the “Pros” column for your situation, that’s a signal to step back — even if the card looks attractive in general marketing.
